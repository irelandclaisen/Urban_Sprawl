# Urban_Sprawl


## Description
In this project, I develop a CNN model to determine if an area is urban or not.  This model could be used to measure urban sprawl over time.

## Context
Urban sprawl has a lot of negative impacts, such as air pollution, traffic congestion, destruction of valuable wild life space, and increased carbon emmisions.  Various cities are enacting policies to try to curb urban sprawl and 
it would be interesting to see which cities, and by inference, which policies, are working best to reduce urban sprawl.  One way to measure urban sprawl is to use
satellite images.  It allows for granular and detailed data.  Machine learning can be applied to these satellite images to determine which areas are urban or not urban as a way to measure 
how much an urban area is spreading over times

## Featured Techniques
 * Satellite Image Processing
 * Using Geospacial Data
 * Convolutional Neural Networks
 * Deep learning
 

## Data
Data was taken from [this link](http://madm.dfki.de/downloads), and Google Earth Engine


## Workflow
* Clean satellite image data
* Develop a CNN model to determine if an area is urban or not
* Apply model onto satellite images of Seattle
